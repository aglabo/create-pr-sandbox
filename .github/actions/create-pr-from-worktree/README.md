# Create PR from Worktree Action

<!-- textlint-disable ja-technical-writing/sentence-length -->
<!-- textlint-disable ja-technical-writing/max-comma -->
<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

A reusable composite action that creates or updates Pull Requests from
worktree with labels and auto-merge enabled.

**🤖 Designed for automated Bot workflows** - This action automatically
enables auto-merge. Ensure your organization's policies permit
auto-merge for Bot-generated PRs before use.

## Prerequisites

Before calling this action, ensure:

1. **You must be on the base branch** - The currently checked-out branch becomes the base branch for the PR (auto-detected)
2. The PR branch (head branch) exists on the remote repository
3. Changes are committed to the PR branch
4. The PR branch is pushed to origin
5. You are not in detached HEAD state

This action focuses solely on GitHub PR operations - it does not perform
git operations like branch creation, commits, or pushes. The base branch is automatically
detected from the currently checked-out branch, and you specify only the PR branch (head branch) as input.

## Features

- Automatic Branch Detection: Auto-detects current branch as PR head - no manual branch name configuration needed
- PR Creation/Update: Creates new PRs or updates existing ones with
  title and body changes
- Flexible Labeling: Auto-creates labels if they don't exist and
  applies them to PRs
- Auto-Merge Support: Enables auto-merge with configurable merge
  methods (merge, squash, rebase)
- Branch Validation: Verifies branches exist on remote before creating PR
- Idempotent: Safe to run multiple times - updates existing PRs
  instead of failing
- Native GitHub CLI: Uses `gh` CLI for maximum flexibility and reliability

## Usage

### Basic Example

```yaml
# Create and push PR branch first (while on base branch)
- name: Create PR branch
  run: |
    # Currently on base branch (e.g., main)
    git checkout -b auto-fix/${{ github.ref_name }}
    git commit -m "fix: Auto-fix issues"
    git push origin auto-fix/${{ github.ref_name }}

# Return to base branch before creating PR
- name: Return to base branch
  run: git checkout ${{ github.ref_name }}

# Create the PR (base branch auto-detected from current branch)
- name: Create Pull Request
  uses: ./.github/actions/create-pr-from-worktree
  with:
    pr-branch: auto-fix/${{ github.ref_name }}
    pr-title: "fix: Auto-fix issues"
    pr-body: "This PR automatically fixes detected issues."
    labels: "automated,fix"
    merge-method: "squash"
```

### Example with Manual Merge (No Auto-Merge)

```yaml
# Create PR without auto-merge for manual review
- name: Create PR branch
  run: |
    # Currently on base branch
    git checkout -b feature/${{ github.ref_name }}
    git commit -m "feat: Add new feature"
    git push origin feature/${{ github.ref_name }}

# Return to base branch
- name: Return to base branch
  run: git checkout ${{ github.ref_name }}

- name: Create Pull Request (manual merge required)
  uses: ./.github/actions/create-pr-from-worktree
  with:
    pr-branch: feature/${{ github.ref_name }}
    pr-title: "feat: Add new feature"
    pr-body: "This PR requires manual review and approval."
    labels: "feature,needs-review"
    merge-method: "never" # Disable auto-merge
```

### Advanced Example

````yaml
# Handle git operations
- name: Create and push PR branch
  run: |
    PR_BRANCH="auto-chmod/${{ github.ref_name }}"

    # Create or update branch
    if git ls-remote --heads origin "$PR_BRANCH" | grep -q "$PR_BRANCH"; then
      git fetch origin "$PR_BRANCH"
      git checkout -B "$PR_BRANCH" "origin/$PR_BRANCH"
    else
      git checkout -b "$PR_BRANCH"
    fi

    # Commit and push
    git config --local user.name "github-actions[bot]"
    git config --local user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
    git commit -m "[Bot] ci(scripts): Fix shell script permissions"
    git push -f origin "$PR_BRANCH"

# Return to base branch before creating PR
- name: Return to base branch
  run: git checkout ${{ github.ref_name }}

# Create PR (base branch auto-detected from current branch)
- name: Create PR with auto-merge
  id: create_pr
  uses: ./.github/actions/create-pr-from-worktree
  with:
    pr-branch: auto-chmod/${{ github.ref_name }}
    pr-title: "[Bot] ci(scripts): Fix shell script permissions"
    pr-body: |
      ## Auto-generated PR: Shell Script Permission Fix

      This PR automatically fixes executable permissions...

      ### Files Modified
      ```
      ${{ steps.chmod.outputs.changed_files }}
      ```

      🤖 Auto-generated by GitHub Actions
    labels: "automated,chore"
    merge-method: "squash"

- name: Check validation result and use outputs
  run: |
    STATUS="${{ steps.create_pr.outputs.validation-status }}"
    MESSAGE="${{ steps.create_pr.outputs.validation-message }}"

    if [ "$STATUS" = "fail" ] || [ "$STATUS" = "error" ]; then
      echo "::error::PR creation skipped: $MESSAGE"
      exit 1
    fi

    if [ "$STATUS" = "warning" ]; then
      echo "::warning::PR created with warnings: $MESSAGE"
    fi

    echo "PR Number: ${{ steps.create_pr.outputs.pr-number }}"
    echo "PR URL: ${{ steps.create_pr.outputs.pr-url }}"
    echo "Operation: ${{ steps.create_pr.outputs.pr-operation }}"
````

### Validation Handling Example

The action follows a **fail-first design** and **does not fail the workflow** even if
validation fails. Instead, it sets the `validation-status` and `validation-message`
outputs, allowing you to handle errors gracefully. PR creation only proceeds when all
validations return `ok`:

```yaml
# Must be on base branch (e.g., main) before calling this action
- name: Checkout base branch
  run: git checkout main

- name: Create PR
  id: create_pr
  uses: ./.github/actions/create-pr-from-worktree
  with:
    pr-branch: feature/my-feature
    pr-title: "New feature"
    pr-body: "Description"

# Option 1: Fail the job if validation failed
- name: Check validation
  if: steps.create_pr.outputs.validation-status != 'ok'
  run: |
    echo "::error::Validation failed: ${{ steps.create_pr.outputs.validation-message }}"
    exit 1

# Option 2: Skip subsequent steps if validation failed
- name: Post-PR tasks
  if: steps.create_pr.outputs.validation-status == 'ok'
  run: echo "PR created successfully"

# Option 3: Handle different validation statuses
- name: Handle validation result
  run: |
    STATUS="${{ steps.create_pr.outputs.validation-status }}"
    MESSAGE="${{ steps.create_pr.outputs.validation-message }}"

    case "$STATUS" in
      ok)
        echo "✓ Validation passed and PR created"
        ;;
      warning)
        echo "::warning::Validation warning (PR not created): $MESSAGE"
        ;;
      fail)
        echo "::error::Validation failed (PR not created): $MESSAGE"
        exit 1
        ;;
      error)
        echo "::error::System error (PR not created): $MESSAGE"
        exit 1
        ;;
    esac
```

| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------ |
| `pr-branch`    | PR branch name (head branch for the pull request)                                         | Yes      | -            |

## Outputs

| Output               | Description                                                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `validation-status`  | Validation result (`ok`, `fail`, `error`, `warning`)                  |
| `validation-message` | Validation status message (provides details about validation results) |
| `pr-number`          | Created/updated PR number                                             |
| `pr-url`             | Pull request URL                                                      |
| `pr-operation`       | Operation performed (`created`, `updated`, `none`)                    |

**Validation Status Values**:

- `ok`: All validations passed successfully
- `fail`: User-fixable validation failure (missing branches, invalid parameters)
- `error`: System/runtime error (API failures, authentication failures)
- `warning`: Validation passed with warnings (e.g., low API rate limit)

**Note**: This action follows a **fail-first design**. PR creation only proceeds when
all validation steps return `ok` status. If any validation returns `fail`, `error`, or
`warning`, the PR creation steps are skipped, and `pr-number`, `pr-url`, and
`pr-operation` will be empty. This ensures PRs are only created in fully validated
environments.

## Branch Requirements and Detection

The action requires both base and PR branches to already exist on the remote repository.

**Base Branch Auto-Detection**:

- The **currently checked-out branch** becomes the base branch (auto-detected using `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD`)
- You must checkout the base branch **before** calling this action
- Only the `pr-branch` (head branch) needs to be specified as input

**Validation**:

1. Base branch is auto-detected from current branch
2. Validates:
   - Base branch exists on remote
   - PR branch exists on remote
   - Base and PR branches are different

**Example branch configurations**:

- Checked out on `main` + `pr-branch: auto-fix/main` → creates PR from `auto-fix/main` → `main`
- Checked out on `feat/new-feature` + `pr-branch: auto-chmod/feat/new-feature` → creates PR from `auto-chmod/feat/new-feature` → `feat/new-feature`

**Important**: You must be on a checked-out branch. Detached HEAD state will cause the action to fail with "Failed to detect current branch name" error.

## Label Management

Labels specified in the `labels` input are:

1. Created automatically if they don't exist (using `gh label create --force`)
2. Applied to the PR
3. Comma-separated (e.g., `"automated,chore,fix"`)

**Note**: Labels are created with default colors. To customize label
colors, create them manually in the repository settings first.

## Auto-Merge Behavior

The action can enable auto-merge with the specified method:

- `squash` (default): Squash commits into one
- `merge`: Standard merge commit
- `rebase`: Rebase and merge
- `never`: Disable auto-merge (PR created without auto-merge enabled)

**When auto-merge is enabled** (`squash`/`merge`/`rebase`):

- Repository must have auto-merge enabled in settings
- Branch protection rules must be satisfied
- Required status checks must pass
- Required approvals must be received
- The PR will automatically merge once all conditions are met

**When auto-merge is disabled** (`never`):

- PR is created or updated normally
- Labels are applied if specified
- Auto-merge is NOT enabled
- Manual merge or approval required

**⚠️ Organization Policy Warning**:

This action is designed for **automated Bot workflows only**. Some
organizations have policies prohibiting auto-merge. Before using this
action:

- Verify your organization allows auto-merge for Bot PRs
- Check if specific merge methods (squash/merge/rebase) are restricted
- Ensure compliance with your team's code review policies
- Consider using `merge-method: "squash"` as the safest default

## Requirements

### Repository Settings

1. **Auto-merge enabled**: Settings → General → Allow auto-merge
2. **Branch protection** (recommended): Protect base branches with
   required checks

### Workflow Permissions

The workflow must have `contents: write` permission:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write # Usually included in contents: write
```

### Authentication

The action automatically uses the workflow's `GITHUB_TOKEN` for all GitHub CLI operations. No explicit token configuration is required.

**For advanced scenarios requiring PAT tokens**, set the `GH_TOKEN` environment variable at the workflow level:

```yaml
env:
  GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.PAT_TOKEN }}

steps:
  - uses: ./.github/actions/create-pr-from-worktree
    # Will inherit GH_TOKEN from workflow env
```

## How It Works

1. **Detect Base Branch**: Auto-detects current branch as base branch using `git symbolic-ref --short HEAD` (fails if in detached HEAD state)
2. **Validate Environment**: Verifies OS, GitHub CLI, and API rate limits (fail-first: must be `ok`)
3. **Validate Branches**: Verifies base and PR branches exist on remote and are different (fail-first: must be `ok`)
4. **Create/Update PR**: Creates new PR or updates existing one with title and body (only if all validations are `ok`)
5. **Apply Labels**: Creates labels if needed and applies them (only if all validations are `ok`)
6. **Enable Auto-Merge**: Configures auto-merge with specified method (only if `merge-method` is not `never`)

## Limitations

- Requires pre-pushed branches: Both base and current branches must
  already exist on remote
- Requires checked-out branch: Cannot run in detached HEAD state
- No git operations: The action does not create branches, commit
  changes, or push code
- Single PR per branch pair: One PR from current branch to
  base branch at a time
- Linux only: The action runs on Linux runners only

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to detect current branch name"

This error occurs when running in detached HEAD state. You must be on the **base branch** when calling this action:

```yaml
# Bad: Detached HEAD state
- run: git checkout HEAD~1

# Bad: On PR branch instead of base branch
- run: git checkout my-pr-branch

# Good: On base branch
- run: git checkout main
- uses: ./.github/actions/create-pr-from-worktree
  with:
    pr-branch: my-pr-branch
```

**Correct workflow pattern**:

```yaml
# 1. Create and push PR branch
- name: Create PR branch
  run: |
    git checkout -b my-pr-branch
    git commit -m "My changes"
    git push origin my-pr-branch

# 2. Return to base branch
- name: Return to base branch
  run: git checkout main

# 3. Create PR (base branch auto-detected as main)
- name: Create PR
  uses: ./.github/actions/create-pr-from-worktree
  with:
    pr-branch: my-pr-branch
    pr-title: "My PR"
    pr-body: "Description"
```

### "Branch does not exist on remote"

Ensure the PR branch is pushed before calling this action, and that you're on the base branch:

```yaml
- name: Create and push PR branch
  run: |
    git checkout -b my-pr-branch
    git commit -m "My changes"
    git push origin my-pr-branch

- name: Return to base branch
  run: git checkout main

- name: Create PR
  uses: ./.github/actions/create-pr-from-worktree
  with:
    pr-branch: my-pr-branch
    pr-title: "My PR"
    pr-body: "Description"
```

### Auto-merge not working

Check:

1. Repository has auto-merge enabled
2. Branch protection rules are satisfied
3. Required status checks are passing
4. Required approvals are received

### Labels not created

The action creates labels with `--force` flag. If this fails:

1. Check workflow token has sufficient permissions (`pull-requests: write`)
2. Verify repository settings allow label creation
